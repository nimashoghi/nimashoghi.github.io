I'm a PhD student in Machine Learning at Georgia Tech, where I am focusing on Deep Learning for Scientific Applications under the guidance of [Dr. Pan Li](https://sites.google.com/view/panli-purdue) and [Dr. Victor Fung](https://cse.gatech.edu/people/victor-fung). I earned my B.S. and M.S. degrees in Computer Science from Georgia Tech, during which I conducted research at the High Performance Computer Architecture Lab on accelerating ML training and inference.  Prior to starting my PhD, I completed a two-year AI residency at Meta AI's FAIR Chemistry team, where I worked on developing large pre-trained models, trained on a diverse mixture of chemical data across multiple domains, for general-purpose chemical property prediction. My research interests lie in the development and application of deep learning techniques to challenging problems in science and engineering. I am particularly excited about the potential for deep learning to accelerate discovery and understanding in fields like chemistry and climate science.

My CV is available [here](files/cv.pdf).
